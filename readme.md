Unedited notes - to tidy

Requirements
* pyzmq is installed, and available on the $PYTHONPATH
* projects are correctly setup in Shotgun, and configured with a shared toolkit core (https://support.shotgunsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/219040468)
* currently default file paths for logs assume a Unix platform, however in theory the code should work on Windows too
